# poster
The poster module for Python, which allows easy HTTP POST-ing of files with urllib - now with Python3 support!

Do NOT use this module if you don't know exactly why you can't use [http://requests.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.4/ requests] instead.

This repository is merely intended to provide basic Python3 support to anyone who depends on this module and would like their project to support Python3 too.
